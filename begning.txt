* get ls-files
list of tracked files

* git rm --cached <file>

* git rm  <file>
to unstage a file & also delete it from working tree

* git mv file_from file_to

* git commit -am "first commit msg"

//////////////////////
* git diff filename
local & index

* git diff HEAD filename
local & HEAD

* git diff --cached filename / git diff --staged filename
index & HEAD
///////////////////////

<<<<<<< HEAD
* git checkout .
copy all files from index to CWD
### WITHOUT ANY CONFILICT & WRNING (not added & not commited data of working dir will be never recover)


* git checkout HEAD .
copy all files from HEAD to index & working dir 
### WITHOUT ANY CONFILICT & WRNING (not added & not commited data of working dir will be never recover)

* git commit -m "del"
after remove file from tracking aria u need to make a commit for delete it form HEAD

* get reset HEAD~n
--mixed               reset HEAD and index
--soft                reset only HEAD
--hard                reset HEAD, index and working tree
--merge               reset HEAD, index and working tree
--keep                reset HEAD but keep local changes
## find HEAD or hash sh1 OF "del" commit , from "git log --oneline" or "git reflog"
## Dangorous command it will remove ur history, DONT USE IT AFTER PUSH COMMAND

Command	Scope	Common use cases
git reset	Commit-level	Discard commits in a private branch or throw away uncommited changes
git reset	File-level	Unstage a file
git checkout	Commit-level	Switch between branches or inspect old snapshots
git checkout	File-level	Discard changes in the working directory
git revert	Commit-level	Undo commits in a public branch
git revert	File-level	(N/A)


git checkout -- . will obviously only work on the current directory (and subdirectories thereof), git reset --hard will operate on the complete working tree.

git checkout -- . will only update the working tree and leave already staged files as is, whereas git reset --hard will match index and working tree with the HEAD commit.

when used with a refspec:

reset will set the current branch head to the given commit (and matches index and working tree)
checkout will switch to that branch, leaving local changes intact, when they touch files which did not change between the current branch and the branch to be checked out
