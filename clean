git clean
// removes untracked files from your working directory
/*
The git clean command is often executed in conjunction with git reset --hard. Remember that resetting only affects tracked files, so a separate command is required for cleaning up untracked ones. Combined, these two commands let you return the working directory to the exact state of a particular commit.
*/

git clean -n 
// only msg :: Perform a “dry run” of git clean. This will show you which files are going to be removed without actually doing it.

git clean -f
// cwd & not subdir

git clean -f <path>
// for a specified path

git clean -df
// subdir also

git clean -xf
// ignores also
